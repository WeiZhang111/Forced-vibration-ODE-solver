# Forced-vibration-ODE-solver
MATLAB code for solving ODE corresponding to forced vibration problems

This MATLAB script gives codes for solving forced nonlinear vibration problem, in which the governing equation reads mx''+cx'+kx+mu*x^3=F(t); m=1,c=0.5,k=1,mu=0,0.01,0.1,1; 
Excitation function is a unit step function. ' means derivative with respect to time.

Solution curves are compared regarding different nonlinearities, i.e. different mu values.
